        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><b>Hello! My name is Cyril Youssef</b>, and I am currently studying Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. I am currently in my third year working towards finishing my degree, excited and ready to tackle the technical industry head-on.</p>
        <p>My interest lies in artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development, and blockchain technologies. I am particularly eager to contribute to and grow within tech-centric environments where technology meets practical applications.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, one of my biggest interests is music. Check out what I’ve been listening to lately!</p>
